\chapter{Background and Theory}
% This chapter should describe the theoretical background needed to understand
% and solve the problem. For instance, a description of the hardware platform
% or specific components involved in this assignment, definition of concepts
% that are important to understand the solution should be summarized here. Add
% citations to show sources whenever appropriate, LaTeX and bibliography
% managers make this easy.

\section{Operating Systems}
An operating system is a special piece of software that provides two important functions in a computer:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Managing the hardware resources.
  \item Providing a useful hardware abstraction layer for application programmers.
\end{itemize}
The core of the operating system is called the \emph{kernel} and runs in a privileged software mode that gives the kernel complete access to all hardware resources. The code running outside the kernel is often referred to as the \emph{user space} or the \emph{userland}, and has only restricted access to hardware. Because of this organization, all hardware-related activities necessary to run the operating system is performed by the kernel, and the user space programs only access hardware through \emph{system calls} in the kernel.
% TODO: Write a brief explaination on OS terminology.
