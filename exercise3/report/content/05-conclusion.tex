\chapter{Conclusion}
% This chapter should be a look back at the entire report and summarizing the
% problem, the solution and the obtained results.

\section{Evaluation of the Assignment}
% You can include comments about the assignment itself here. While this part is
% not obligatory and not graded, it is valuable feedback to the course staff
% that can be used to improve the exercises in the future.

\subsection{Compendium Feedback}
This section contains feedback and suggested improvements for the compendium.

\subsubsection{Mention \texttt{ptxdist clean} in section 5.3.3}
As mentioned in the compendium in section \textbf{5.3.3. Building and Flashing}, a single package can be flashed with the following four commands:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{ptxdist compile <packagename>, e.g game or driver-gamepad}
  \item \texttt{ptxdist targetinstall <packagename>}
  \item \texttt{ptxdist image root.romfs}
  \item \texttt{ptxdist test flash-rootfs}
\end{enumerate}
However, in order for the modified sources to be compiled, we also needed run one of the commands \texttt{ptxdist clean game} and \texttt{ptxdist drop game compile}. Maybe it would be useful to mention this in this section.
