The market for embedded computing systems is growing, creating a need for developers with knowledge of embedded computing technology. The university-level course TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems meets this trend, giving its students an introduction to energy-efficient software development for embedded computing systems. In the third exercise of the course, we wrote a computer game for the EFM32GG-DK3750 prototyping board running under the uClinux operating system. To access custom hardware, we needed to write our own device driver. We then implemented a clone of the game \"asteroids\" running on top of the operating system, interfacing with the drivers we implemented.
