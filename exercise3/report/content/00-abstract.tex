\begin{abstract}
% An abstract is a short (100 to 500 words), high-level summary of the entire
% document. For this kind of report, you would start by introducing the concept
% that the report talks about and the goals of the work, followed by
% information about how the work was done and some summary of results.

This report covers a description about writing a videogame for the EFM32GG-DK3750 prototyping board running under the uClinux operating system. In addition, to access hardware, a custom device driver was written. We implement a clone of the game "Asteroids" running on top of the operating system, interfacing with our own custom drivers. The resulting performance is measured with different optimizations and work loads, showing that even with an optimized drawing routine the board spends 8 mA to draw the graphics for asteroids, out of a total 20 mA. These findings show that efficient drawing has a large energy reduction payoff, and that spending time implementing complex algorithms to limit screen update area is worth considerable effort.
