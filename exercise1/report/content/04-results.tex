\chapter{Results}
% In this chapter, you should discuss the results you have obtained from your implementation.
% These can be correctness results, i.e whether the implementation behaved as expected, or numerical results that express runtime or energy measurements.

With our polling implementation as a baseline we measured ??ampere, regardless of button input. As expected, the polling method consumes a lot of energy since it constantly runs instructions whether they are needed or not. (fig)

Our interrupt based program fared much better, averaging around 1.5µA (fig), and expending about 83µA when a button was held down. (fig)

In search of further improvement we powered down idle SRAM blocks to save more power, resulting in around 1µA(fig), a pretty substantial improvement from the simple interrupt based program. With a button held down however the difference was negligible.(fig)
