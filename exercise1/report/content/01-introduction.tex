\chapter{Introduction}
% Your report should start with an introduction chapter that motivates the subject in general and describes the problem you are trying to solve.

There is a strong focus in the embedded computing industry towards energy-efficiency. By using more energy-efficient components, large expenses are cut, battery-time of small devices is increased, and environmental footprint is reduced. Silicon Labs is among the leading providers of energy-efficient hardware. The EFM32GG-DK3750 development kit by silicon labs provides a rich feature set with state of the art power-saving technology, making it a flexible development platform and a good starting point for developers to learn about developing energy-efficient embedded computing systems.

In the first exercise we will use the EFM32GG-DK3750 development kit as a prototyping board, connecting it to a specially built gamepad with LEDs and buttons. The task is to write a small program that allows the user to control the LEDs on the gamepad by pushing the buttons. All code will be written in assembly using the Thumb-2 instruction set, and no operating system will be running. The purpose of the exercise is to introduce the development kit hardware, to become familiar with low-level software programming, and to learn software development using the GNU-toolchain.
