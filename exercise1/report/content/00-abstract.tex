\begin{abstract}
In this exercise we have explored basic features of the EFM32GG-DK3750 development kit, including how to connect it to a computer for loading code and monitoring its state, how to interface with it via a prototype gamepad, and how to monitor energy efficiency of our programs with EnergyAware Profiler. On the development end we learned how to use a toolchain for compiling and loading files onto the microcontroller, how to use the GNU Debugger with GDBServer to debug running code, some basic ARM assembly for the Cortex-M3 microprocessor and how to control the rest of the board by writing and reading memory.

To do this we have implemented a small program mapping buttons to LEDs, first with a simple polling loop, then with a more sophisticated interrupt based program.
