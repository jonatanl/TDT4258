\chapter{Conclusion}
By implementing both a sample based playback and an on board synthesizer we were able to quantify the differences between the approaches. As expected the synthesizer drew more power, having to do more calculations than the sample based approach. On the other hand the synthesizer was much more space efficient, allowing much more versatility for a computational premium. In addition to learning a lot about playing sound, we also learned a lot about developing embedded code with C, having to deal with a very different way of organizing code than we were used to, coming from more high level languages.
