\begin{abstract}

In this exercise we implement two different way of handling audio generation for the EFM32GG utilizing the Digital Analog Converter using C with no operating system. We show how the different approaches differ in sound quality, energy consumption and size. To control the output we also implement functionality to handle button inputs, mapping them to various songs and sound effects. %% TODO something about results
