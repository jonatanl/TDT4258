The course TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems gives an introduction to energy-efficient microcontroller programming.Through lectures and three comprehensive exercises the students get theoretical knowledge as well as hands-on experience.

In this second exercise of the course we implement two different ways of handling audio generation for the EFM32GG utilizing the Digital Analog Converter using C with no operating system. We show how the different approaches differ in sound quality, energy consumption and size. To control the output we also implement functionality to handle button inputs, mapping them to various songs and sound effects.

%Our results show that computation time matters.

%Comparing two implementations for sound generation, we found that the power consumption of the more compute intensive implementation was actually worse in a lower energy mode.
