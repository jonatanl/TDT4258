\chapter{Results}
TODO
% In this chapter, you should discuss the results you have obtained from your
% implementation. These can be correctness results, i.e whether the
% implementation behaved as expected, or numerical results that express runtime
% or energy measurements.

\section{Energy modes}
In the time between each interrupt we placed the board in sleep mode. We measured energy consumption in EM0, EM1 and EM2. The results can be seen in table \ref{tab:benchmarkEnergyModes}. In our case EM1 gave best results and not EM2 as first expected.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }
	  \hline
	  EM0 & EM1 & EM2 \\
	  \hline
	  4.85 mA & 4.02 mA & 4.51 mA \\
	  \hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Energy consumption with different energy modes}
